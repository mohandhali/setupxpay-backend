     * Get specified events
     * <p><b>20 credits per API call</b></p>
     * <p>Get all events on given addresses and / or in the requested block range on the following blockchains:</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>Celo - celo / celo-testnet</li>
     * <li>Ethereum - ethereum / ethereum-sepolia / ethereum-holesky</li>
     * <li>BNB (Binance) Smart Chain - bsc / bsc-testnet</li>
     * <li>Polygon - polygon</li>
     * <li>Horizen EON - eon-mainnet</li>
     * <li>Chiliz - chiliz-mainnet</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>To get started:</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>To improve response times and obtain specific data, it is recommended to use proper filtering techniques. Please provide a chain name and a combination of filters that will accomplish this (at least block range or contract addresses must be specified).</li>
     * <li>It is possible to specify multiple contract addresses at once by passing them as a comma separated string.</li>
     * <li>If block range is not specified, the API attempts to go through all available blocks, which may result in a timeout error.</li>
     * <li>When you are filtering data using blockFrom and not using blockTo, blockTo is automatically added as blockFrom + 1000. The same applies when blockTo is present and blockFrom is not. In that case blockFrom is automatically added as blockTo - 1000.</li>
     * <li>It is recommended to filter only one specific type of events, which comes with built-in decoding for all the supported types.</li>
     * <li>It is, however, also possible to filter by signature hashes, which can be passed together as a comma separated string.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>As noted above, aside from general info and hashed event data, the API also decodes them for you in case you filter by one of the following supported event types:</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li><code>tokenTransfer</code>: All transfers of fungible tokens (including stablecoins) and NFTs as per ERC-20 and ERC-721 standard.</li>
     * <li><code>multitokenTransfer</code>: All transfers of multitokens (both single transfers and batch transfers) as per ERC-1155 standard.</li>
     * <li><code>stablecoinTransfer</code>: Refers to the transfer of specific stablecoins on the mainnet. Typically, the top 10 to 16 stablecoins on each chain according to CoinMarketCap are included. If the <code>contractAddresses</code> parameter is also used in the filter combination, any tokens specified in it will also be included in the list.</li>
     * <li><code>uniswapTrade</code>: Provides all swap events that occur on both Uniswap V2 and V3. In some cases, it may not be possible to map the swapped amounts to specific tokens. As a result, certain decoded data such as token amounts might be missing or in the original big number format. This will be indicated by the response parameter <code>partiallyRaw: true</code>.</li>
     * </ul>

     * @param chain The blockchain to work with.
     * @param contractAddresses The blockchain addresses of the contracts where requested events were emitted.

     *
     * @param blockFrom First block to start from (including this one).
