     * Create an NFT marketplace
     * <p><b>2 credits per API call</b></p>
     * <p>Deploy an NFT marketplace smart contract on the blockchain. With a deployed marketplace smart contract, you and your customers can create new  listings for assets such as non-fungible tokens and combinations of token types as described by the ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards on the Ethereum blockchain or by the equivalent standards on the other blockchains. As the marketplace operator, you can set a fee as a percentage of the asset price that will be paid on top of the asset price.</p>
     * <p>The purchase process looks like the following:</p>
     * <ol>
     * <li>The seller <a href="#operation/SellAssetOnMarketplace">creates a listing for an asset on the NFT marketplace</a>. The listing can be offered for the native blockchain assets (for example, ETH, BSC, and so on) or for the fungible tokens of the blockchain.</li>
     * <li>The seller <a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Auction#operation/ApproveNftAuctionSpending" target="_blank">allows the marketplace smart contract to transfer the asset that they are selling</a>.</li>
     * <li>A buyer buys the asset.
     * <ul><li>If the buyer wants to pay with the <b>native blockchain assets</b>, they <a href="#operation/BuyAssetOnMarketplace">make the purchase</a> (the <code>buyAssetFromListing()</code> method is called against the marketplace smart contract) and send the required amount of the native assets to the marketplace smart contract.</li>
     * <li>If the buyer wants to pay with the <b>fungible tokens</b>:
     * <ol><li>The buyer <a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Fungible-Tokens-(ERC-20-or-compatible)#operation/Erc20Approve" target="_blank">allows the marketplace smart contract to access their tokens</a> and makes the purchase (the <code>buyAssetFromListing()</code> method is called against the marketplace smart contract).</li>
     * <li>The marketplace smart contract deducts the required amount of tokens from the smart contract where the buyer holds the tokens.</li></ol></li></ul></li>
     * <li>The marketplace smart contract transfers the asset to the buyer, transfers the asset price to the seller, and sends the fee to the marketplace fee recipient.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <p>This API is supported for the following blockchains:</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>BNB Smart Chain</li>

     * <p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>
     * When deploying an NFT marketplace smart contract, you are charged a fee for the transaction, and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted.</p>
     * <p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions, because the private key can be stolen or exposed.
