     * <li>Using mnemonic - all of the addresses, that are generated from the mnemonic are scanned for the incoming deposits
     * which are used as a source of the transaction. Assets, which are not used in a transaction are moved to the system address wih the derivation index 0. Address with index 0 cannot be assigned automatically to any account and is used for custodial wallet use cases. For non-custodial wallets, field <b>attr</b> should be present and it should be address with the index 1 of the connected wallet.</li>
     * <li>Using keyPair - addresses which are used as a source of the transaction are entered manually</li>
     * </ul>
     * It is possible to perform ledger to blockchain transaction for ledger accounts without blockchain address assigned to them.<br/>
     * This method is a helper method, which internally wraps these steps:

     * <li><a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Withdrawal#operation/storeWithdrawal">Store withdrawal</a> - create a ledger transaction, which debits the assets on the sender account.</li>

     * </ol>
     * When some of the steps fails, <a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Withdrawal#operation/cancelInProgressWithdrawal">Cancel withdrawal</a> operation is used, which cancels withdrawal and creates refund transaction to the sender account.</li>
     * This operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key.

     * <p><b>4 credits per API call</b></p>
     * <p>Deploy a KuCoin Community Chain (KCC) ERC-20-equivalent smart contract. This is a helper method, which is combination of
     * <a href="#operation/registerErc20Token">Register new Kcs ERC20 token in the ledger</a> and <a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Fungible-Tokens-(ERC-20-or-compatible)#operation/Erc20Deploy">Deploy blockchain ERC20</a>.</p>
     * <p>After deploying a contract to blockchain, the contract address will become available and must be stored within Tatum. Otherwise, it will not be possible to interact with it and starts automatic blockchain synchronization.</p>
     * <p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>
     * When deploying a KCC ERC-20-equivalent smart contract to the blockchain and a virtual account, you are charged a fee for the transaction, and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted.</p>
     * <p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions, because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>
     * <p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Key Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API.

     * <p>First step to create new TRC 10/20 token with given supply on the Tron blockchain with support of Tatum's private ledger.<br/>
     * This method only creates Tatum Private ledger virtual currency with predefined parameters. It will not generate any blockchain smart contract.<br/>
     * The whole supply of TRC 10/20 token is stored in the customer's newly created account. Then it is possible to create new Tatum accounts with TRC 10/20 token name as account's currency.<br/>
     * Newly created account is frozen until the specific TRC 10/20 smart contract address is linked with the Tatum virtual currency, representing the token.<br/>
     * Order of the steps to create TRC 10/20 smart contract with Tatum private ledger support:
     * <ol>
     * <li>Create TRC 10/20 token (this API) - creates a virtual currency within Tatum</li>
     * <li><a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Tron#operation/TronCreateTrc10">Deploy TRC 10</a> or <a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Tron#operation/TronCreateTrc20">TRC 20 smart contract</a> - create new TRC 10/20 smart contract on the blockchain</li>
     * <li><a href="#operation/storeTokenAddress">Store TRC 10/20 smart contract address</a> - link newly created TRC 10/20 smart contract address with Tatum virtual currency - this operation enables frozen account and enables ledger synchronization for TRC 10/20 Tatum accounts</li>
     * </ol>
     * Blockchain address will be assigned to the virtual account as a deposit address. It can be defined via the address explicitly or by using xpub and derivationIndex.
     * There is a helper method <a href="#operation/TronDeployTrc">Deploy TRC 10/20 Smart Contract to Blockchain and Ledger</a>, which wraps first 2 steps into 1 method.<br/>
