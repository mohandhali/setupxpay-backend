     * Create an NFT auction
     * <p><b>2 credits per API call</b></p>
     * <p>Deploy new smart contract for NFT auction logic. Smart contract enables auction operator to create new auction for NFT (ERC-721/1155).
     * Operator can set a fee in percentage, which will be paid on top of the price of the asset.
     * can be offered for native asset - ETH, BSC, etc. - or any ERC20 token - this is configurable during auction creation.
     * Before auction is created, seller must approve transfer of the NFT to the auction contract.
     * Buyer will bid for the asset from the auction using native asset - send assets along the gid() smart contract call, or via ERC20 token.
     * Buyer of the auction must perform approval for the smart contract to access ERC20 token, before the actual bid() method is called.
     * Once there is higher bid then the actual one, the previous bidder's funds will be returned to him and new bidder will be the current winning one.
     * When auction ends, anyone can settle the auction - NFT will be sent to the bidder, assets to the seller and fee to the operator.<br/>
     * This operation deploys a smart contract on the blockchain.</p>
